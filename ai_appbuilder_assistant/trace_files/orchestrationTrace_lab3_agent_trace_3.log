      "text": "To design secure VPCs on AWS, follow these best practices:\n\n**Network Segmentation**\n- Define separate network layers and segment workloads into isolated VPCs for ingress, egress, and inspection flows\n- Use VPC peering, AWS Transit Gateway, or AWS PrivateLink to control traffic between VPCs\n\n**Network Protection**\n- Implement inspection services like AWS Network Firewall, AWS WAF, and Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall to inspect and control network traffic\n- Use security groups, network ACLs, and route tables as additional layers of defense\n\n**Automation and Governance**\n- Automate network resource deployment using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation\n- Store IaC templates in version control and use CI/CD pipelines with automated testing\n- Establish a central Network account to define and share network resources across the organization using AWS Resource Access Manager\n- Delegate certain network controls to individual workload teams\n\n**Monitoring and Response**\n- Enable VPC flow logs and review firewall logs\n- Follow incident response best practices to detect and respond to unauthorized access"
