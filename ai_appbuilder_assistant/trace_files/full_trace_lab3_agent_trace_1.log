The `re` module is imported to work with regular expressions.\n2. The `validate_email` function takes an email address as a string argument.\n3. The regular expression pattern `r'^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+$'` is used to validate the email address syntax. Here's what it means:\n   - `^` and `$` are anchors that match the start and end of the string, respectively.\n   - `[\\w\\.-]+` matches one or more word characters (`\\w`), periods (`.`), or hyphens (`-`). This part matches the local part of the email address (before the `@` symbol).\n   - `@` matches the literal `@` symbol.\n   - `[\\w\\.-]+` matches one or more word characters, periods, or hyphens. This part matches the domain name (after the `@` symbol).\n   - `\\.` matches a literal period.\n   - `\\w+` matches one or more word characters. This part matches the top-level domain (e.g., `com`, `org`, `net`).\n4. The `re.match` function is used to match the email address against the regular expression pattern.\n5. If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating a valid email address. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n6. The function is demonstrated with two example email addresses: `valid@example.com` (valid) and `invalid@example` (invalid).\n\nNote that this function only validates the syntax of the email address. It does not check if the email address actually exists or is deliverable."

The `re` module is imported to work with regular expressions.\n2. The `validate_email` function takes an email address as a string argument.\n3. The regular expression pattern `r'^[w.-]+@[w.-]+.w+$'` is used to validate the email address syntax. Here's what it means:\n   - `^` and `$` are anchors that match the start and end of the string, respectively.\n   - `[w.-]+` matches one or more word characters (`w`), periods (`.`), or hyphens (`-`). This part matches the local part of the email address (before the `@` symbol).\n   - `@` matches the literal `@` symbol.\n   - `[w.-]+` matches one or more word characters, periods, or hyphens. This part matches the domain name (after the `@` symbol).\n   - `.` matches a literal period.\n   - `w+` matches one or more word characters. This part matches the top-level domain (e.g., `com`, `org`, `net`).\n4. The `re.match` function is used to match the email address against the regular expression pattern.\n5. If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating a valid email address. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n6. The function is demonstrated with two example email addresses: `valid@example.com` (valid) and `invalid@example` (invalid).\n\nNote that this function only validates the syntax of the email address. It does not check if the email address actually exists or is deliverable."
